# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This repository documents the journey and key learnings from implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, aimed at enhancing efficiency and scalability within cloud-based processes.

## Project Overview

The project encapsulates a series of steps to establish a robust IaC framework:

- **Environment Setup:**
  - Installation and configuration of Terraform on a Windows environment.
  - Downloading and setting up the AWS CLI Installer for Windows.

- **AWS Configuration:**
  - Creation of an IAM user through the AWS Console.
  - Configuration of AWS credentials to interface with AWS services.

- **Terraform Execution:**
  - Provisioning of AWS resources through Terraform scripts, including:
    - An IAM Role designated for the EKS Cluster.
    - The default VPC and associated Public Subnets.
    - An IAM Role tailored for the EKS Node Group.

The above steps are a concise representation of the project's scope, designed for clarity and ease of understanding.
